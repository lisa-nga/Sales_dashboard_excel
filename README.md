# Excel Sales Interactive Dashboard

## Introduction
The sales dashboard shows the trend in sales for different categories of products between 20221 and 2022. The dataset used for the analysis was obtained from Kaggle.

## Data Cleaning
- Used filter to check for blanks
- Removed duplicates
- Calculated new columns for total buying vlue and Total selling value
- Using the data, I then proceeded to create pivot tables and charts to visualize. I also inserted slicers to make the dashboard more dynamic.
