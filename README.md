# Excel Sales Interactive Dashboard

## Introduction
The sales dashboard shows the trend in sales for different categories of products between 20221 and 2022. The dataset used for the analysis was obtained from Kaggle.

## Data Cleaning
- I used filters to check for blanks
- I removed duplicates
- Calculated new columns for Total Buying Value and Total Selling Value
- Using the data, I used formulas to create new columns and transformed them into pivot tables and charts to visualize. I also inserted slicers to make the dashboard more dynamic.
